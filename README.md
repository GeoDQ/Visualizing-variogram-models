# Visualizing-variogram-models
Variogram measures the variability of pairs of data points at various spacing distances(i.e.lag). Variogram computation and modelling is an important tool for geospatial data analysis. Here I developed python functions for computing and plotting variogram models, which can be used for fitting variogram models to the experimental variogram data.
